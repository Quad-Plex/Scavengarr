# Review of the external Claude Code skills

> **Purpose:** The state of the external Claude Code skills against their upstream sources and the repository, with the evidence and the planned patches.
> **Status:** reference
> **As of:** 6d1483de

## Scope

Part B of 3: the external skills of `.devcontainer/setup.sh` (`SKILL_SOURCES`, `CAVEMAN_SKILLS`, `RETIRED_SKILLS`) and graphify; the own skills are in [skill-review-2026-11-own.md](skill-review-2026-11-own.md).
This review changes no skill, no `setup.sh` and no `docs/agents/skills.md`; the patches below are plans.

Each skill is checked for (a) the installed copy against the upstream `HEAD`, (b) its use line in `docs/agents/skills.md` against the skill's own text and the repository, (c) overlap with another skill, an own skill or a built-in Claude Code command and (d) the `RETIRED_SKILLS` entry against the table "Removed".
Status values: `aktuell` (correct as it is), `patchen` (refresh or lines to change), `zusammenlegen` (keep one of two), `fraglich` (use in doubt).
"Installed" is the `SKILL.md` blob in `/opt/coding-skills/.claude/skills/`, "upstream" the blob of the same path at the default branch's `HEAD`; "1 change behind" means the installed blob is the parent's blob of the last commit that touched the file.
The raw command output behind every claim is in the evidence section; a label such as E-upstream names its block.

## The skills

| Skill | Source (extern, pin/ref) | Status | Evidence | Planned patch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | obra/superpowers, no ref pin; `main` 22f0b463e7a5 (tag v7.0.2) | `patchen` | E-upstream: installed 7f5eef02f894, upstream 9eb0edc7fedf, +60 -38. E-net: 1 change behind (v7.0.2). E-use: SKILL.md:225 writes the design to `docs/superpowers/specs/`, :226 lets the user's preference override it. E-detail: SKILL.md:28 asks for "the approaches", no count; skills.md:47 says "at least three options". | Refresh to v7.0.2 after its release notes. skills.md:47: the design goes to `docs/plans/` or `openspec/changes/` (AGENTS.md:58), and the three options are the owner's rule, not the skill's. |
| `writing-plans`, `test-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `systematic-debugging`, `verification-before-completion`, `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review` | obra/superpowers, as above | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same` for all seven. E-use: writing-plans SKILL.md:16 defaults to `docs/superpowers/plans/`, :17 lets a preference override it; skills.md:49 and AGENTS.md:58 set `docs/plans/`. | None. |
| `executing-plans` | obra/superpowers, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: ac77129d7c69 against ea23196d7450, +6 -4. E-net: 1 change behind (v7.0.2). | Refresh. |
| `subagent-driven-development` | obra/superpowers, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: ea170ed101d6 against 45195787cb3f, +7 -4. E-net: 1 change behind (v7.0.2). E-use: SKILL.md:8 sends "a fresh implementer subagent per task"; E-overlap: AGENTS.md:173 allows subagents "Only for mechanical, fully specified tasks". | Refresh. skills.md:63 adds the limit of AGENTS.md section 8. |
| `handoff`, `grill-me` | mattpocock/skills, no ref pin; `main` 4ae2317ddb22 (tag v1.3.2) | `patchen` | E-upstream: `same` for both. E-use: both carry `disable-model-invocation: true`, so only a user's `/handoff` or `/grill-me` runs them; skills.md:37 and :48 do not say so. | skills.md marks both "user-invoked only". |
| `recall`, `reflect` | pwguler/skills, no ref pin; `main` 0c8a2eb35acb (tag v1.38.0) | `patchen` | E-upstream: `same` for both. E-use: both carry `disable-model-invocation: true`; skills.md:38 and :39 describe them as session steps without that limit. | skills.md marks both "user-invoked only"; a headless task cannot run them. |
| `rubric` | pwguler/skills, as above | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same`. E-use: the description (defect review with independent read-only reviewers) matches skills.md:82. | None. |
| `writing-for-agents` | mattpocock/skills, as above | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same`. E-use: "Use when creating or editing skills, or modifying AGENTS.md" matches skills.md:41. | None. |
| `domain-modeling` | mattpocock/skills, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: `same`. E-use: the description names "a GLOSSARY.md"; E-repo: the glossary is `docs/reference/glossary.md`. | skills.md:51 names `docs/reference/glossary.md` as the glossary. |
| `research` | mattpocock/skills, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: fecee97e9457 against ffc9eb89849c, +1 -1. E-net: 1 change behind (7739eaed7f8f). E-extra: upstream line 6 adds "Start it with a fresh context window." | Refresh. |
| `api-and-interface-design`, `codebase-design` | addyosmani/agent-skills (`main` 301b02b12bff, tag 0.6.15) and mattpocock/skills | `zusammenlegen` | E-use: api "Use when designing APIs, module boundaries, or any public interface", codebase-design "design or improve a module's interface"; skills.md:54 "contracts, ports and module boundaries", :55 "the cut of packages and modules". E-upstream: api 3e2e37f8f4fb against ce58d72ed0ee, +3 -1, 1 change behind; codebase-design `same`. | The maintainer keeps one skill for module interfaces and removes the other through `RETIRED_SKILLS`; until then refresh api-and-interface-design. |
| `spec-driven-development` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `fraglich` | E-upstream: f54426bec00b against 3fcc536f14f2, +1 -1, 1 change behind. E-overlap: AGENTS.md:6 and :11 send proposals and specs to `openspec/AGENTS.md`, `openspec/changes/` holds 6 entries; E-use: SKILL.md:103 writes to `docs/`; brainstorming also writes a design. | The maintainer decides between OpenSpec and this skill for specs; skills.md:50 names the one in force. |
| `documentation-and-adrs` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: ecc28cef82b6 against eff8fddc25d9, +3 -2, 1 change behind. E-use: SKILL.md:40 `docs/adr/`, :48 `docs/decisions/`; E-repo: AGENTS.md:55 `docs/target/decisions/`. | Refresh. skills.md:52 names `docs/target/decisions/`. |
| `incremental-implementation`, `observability-and-instrumentation` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same` for both; E-use: the descriptions match skills.md:65 and :68. | None. |
| `code-simplification` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `fraglich` | E-upstream: 239b28484895 against c4f794aa3fc6, +1 -1, 1 change behind. The skill list of this session (no command output) carries Claude Code's built-in `simplify` ("Review the changed code for reuse, simplification ... then apply the fixes"), the reason skills.md:90 gives for `code-review`. | The maintainer decides a retirement like `code-review`'s; else refresh. |
| `performance-optimization` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: ff57eab055e7 against 296cf3f79eaa, +2 -2, 1 change behind. skills.md:69 says "queries, projections, load assumptions"; E-extra: `projection` is in 0 files of `src/`, SKILL.md:16 starts from Core Web Vitals. | Refresh. skills.md:69: latency of the I/O paths, measured as `docs/how-to/performance-measurement.md` says. |
| `ci-cd-and-automation` | addyosmani/agent-skills, as above | `patchen` | E-upstream: 118456fcb102 against 531bb8f08595, +7 -4. E-net: 3 changes behind (from d3ffa3cabd0d). The use line skills.md:70 matches the description. | Refresh. |
| `ponytail`, `ponytail-review`, `ponytail-audit`, `ponytail-debt` | DietrichGebert/ponytail, no ref pin; `main` 96608e078b2d (tag v5.3.3) | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same` for all four. Overlap of `ponytail-review` with other review skills: see [Overlap](#overlap). | None. |
| `humanizer` | blader/humanizer, no ref pin; `main` b48c832f0f80 (tag v4.0.0) | `patchen` | E-upstream: 19fc634208e8 against 175bf05f45ae, +151 -50. E-net: older than the last 3 changes. E-detail: installed `version: "3.1.0"`; E-extra: upstream `version: "4.0.0"`. E-upstream: 16 commits since 2026-11-01. | Read the 4.0.0 changes, then refresh; an unpinned source takes a major release unread. |
| `impeccable` | pbakaus/impeccable, no ref pin; `main` c1e0e5492fbb (tag skill-v4.8.2) | `fraglich` | E-repo: installed `version: 4.7.1`, upstream `version: 4.8.2`; E-upstream: 213 commits since 2026-11-01. E-repo: the only tracked HTML, CSS and JS files are 6 test fixtures; the project has no interface of its own. | The maintainer decides a retirement; else refresh. |
| `diagram-design` | cathrynlavery/diagram-design, no ref pin, no tag; `main` f2496acbde9f | `fraglich` | E-upstream: e6162989c378 against 22544df735bf, +11 -11; E-net: older than the last 3 changes; 34 commits since 2026-11-01. E-extra: 0 tracked SVG files; E-overlap: 14 files of `docs/` use Mermaid; skills.md:71 "diagrams beyond Mermaid". | The maintainer decides a retirement; else refresh. |
| `security-audit` | cloudflare/security-audit-skill, no ref pin, no tag; `main` c1c8a8c14710 | `aktuell` | E-upstream: `same`; last upstream commit 2026-09-14. | None. |
| `caveman` (and `CAVEMAN_SKILLS`) | JuliusBrussee/caveman, no ref pin; `main` 3dc497a7f858 (tag v4.1.0) | `patchen` | E-upstream: `caveman` `same`; `cavecrew`, `caveman-explore`, `caveman-review`, `caveman-compress`, `caveman-help`, `caveman-stats` are `not-installed`. E-sources: setup.sh:51 lists all seven, skills.md names the six 0 times (`exit=1`). | Recommended: `CAVEMAN_SKILLS=(caveman)`, the set skills.md records. Alternative: skills.md records the six. |
| `graphify` | Graphify-Labs/graphify (own installer); default branch `v8` 35d1d2038b9e, tag v0.9.106 | `patchen` | E-detail: `graphify 0.9.92` installed; E-upstream: newest tag v0.9.106, 293 commits since 2026-11-01. skills.md:72 matches the description (E-use). | Upgrade the package (`pipx upgrade graphifyy`), then `graphify install --platform claude` again. |
| `code-review` (retired) | mattpocock/skills | `patchen` | E-sources: setup.sh:79 `RETIRED_SKILLS=(code-review)` and skills.md:90 agree, but `ls -d $S/code-review` gives `exit=0`, and the skill list of this session (no command output) still offers it. setup.sh:82 tests `$HOME/.claude/skills/$skill`; E-repo: that folder holds only `synced`, the installed set is the mount `/opt/coding-skills/.claude/skills`. | The build of the mount applies `RETIRED_SKILLS` too, or setup.sh tests the folder the skills are installed in. |

## Overlap

- Reviews: `ponytail-review`, `rubric`, `requesting-code-review`, the built-in `/code-review` and `/security-review`, and the retired but installed `code-review` all review a diff. skills.md:80 makes `ponytail-review` the required one; the others need a line on when they run instead.
- Specs and plans: `brainstorming` (design to `docs/superpowers/specs/`), `spec-driven-development` (`docs/`), `writing-plans` (`docs/plans/` by override) and OpenSpec (`openspec/changes/`, AGENTS.md:6). One home per artifact: plans in `docs/plans/`, spec changes in `openspec/changes/` (AGENTS.md:58).
- Module interfaces: `api-and-interface-design` and `codebase-design` (row above).
- Own skills: `ci-cd-and-automation` and `verification-before-completion` touch the gates of the own `commit` skill (part A); `caveman-commit` stays out because of it (E-overlap: setup.sh:49).

## Pins and install path

- `SKILL_SOURCES` pins no ref: every attach installs the upstream `HEAD` of each source (setup.sh:74). Only the CLI is pinned: `skills@1.7.2` (setup.sh:50), the newest is 1.8.1 (E-net).
- The installed copies date from 2026-11-01 (E-sources); 13 of the 35 skill files of `SKILL_SOURCES` differ from upstream, 9 of them by 1 change, `ci-cd-and-automation` by 3 and three by more than 3 (E-upstream, E-net).
- No source is archived; all 11 sources answered (E-upstream).
- The skills of this environment are not in `$HOME/.claude/skills`, where `setup.sh` installs and retires them, but in a mount (E-repo); `setup.sh` does not build this environment's set.

## Limits

- Only `SKILL.md` is compared; the other files of a skill folder (references, scripts) are not.
- "Aktuell" holds at the queries of this review; with no ref pin, the next attach installs whatever `HEAD` is then.
- The usage record ends on 2026-10-25 (E-usage), so no status rests on invocation counts; the two-week rule of skills.md:25 needs a new record.
- The first two GraphQL queries, which asked for whole file trees, answered `gh: HTTP 502`; the smaller path queries in E-upstream and E-net answered.
- No clone of an upstream repository; the release notes of v7.0.2, humanizer 4.0.0 and impeccable 4.8.2 are not read.

## Evidence

Each block is the output of `bash .devdata/review-ext/evidence.sh <section>` from the repository root, unchanged except for the trailing blanks that `cut -c` leaves (stripped for the whitespace hook): `$ <command>`, its output, `exit=<code>`.
`$S` is `/opt/coding-skills/.claude/skills`, `$D` is `.devdata/review-ext`; the `.graphql`, `.jq` and `.py` helpers and the fetched `.json` files lie there.
